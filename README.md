# Blog_Template
CRUD based blog application using HTML, CSS, JS/EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose Middleware
This was a basic web app that I developed in my first semester of second year at Munster Technological University (MTU). Prior to this, I had little knowledge with database platforms, outside of working with a MySQL DBMS the year previous.

# Important info:
It is important to run npm install in the folder in your IDE, in order to view this project. I used localhost to view this, by running the nodemon command.
